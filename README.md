Streets & Minor Park Tree Coverage (McCarren Park, for example) from NYC Department of Parks & Recreation:
  2015 Tree Census: [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh]
  Forestry Tree Points: [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Forestry-Tree-Points/k5ta-2trh]

As of April 2021, NYC Parks & Recreation does not publicly make data available for the coordinates of trees in major parks including; Central Park, Prospect Park, Highland Park, Forest Park, Flushing Meadows, Cunningham Park, Inwood Park, Van Cortlandt Park, Bronx River Forests, LaTourette Park, Great Kills Park, Freshkills Park, etc.

Our map's Tree Coverage for major parks is based directly on citizen counts when available -  Edward Sibley Barnard and Ken Chaya's amazing map of every tree in Central Park [http://centralparknature.com/], NGOs like the Prospect Park Alliance [https://www.prospectpark.org/learn-more/what-we-do/sustaining-environment/trees/treekeeper-database/], or internet searchable documents such as Bloomberg-era specific park "Urban Forest Management Plan" pdfs. When such counts were not available, we have estimated tree coverage using a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index between the Near-Infrared and Red bands and estimated tree counts by comparing of satellite images to parks of known counts.
